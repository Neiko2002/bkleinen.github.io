# WTAT 1 - Agile Web Development
## Welcome!

WTAT1 - Agile Web Development is a class that combines learning web development with an Agile Project.

Within the class you will design and develop a web application within a small team. Your team is free to choose the topic.

Throughout the project, you will build features into your project that allow you to learn and practice certain aspects of web development and the technology used. See the Schedule and the Topics list for details.

## Class Contents

- Agile Development
- Scrum Methods, Ceremonies and Artefacts
- Web Application Basics
- View Templates, Model View Controller
- Node, Express, Javascript
- Persistence, MongoDB
- Authentication and Web Security
- React
- Real Time Communication
- Continuous Deployment

## Meetings and Due Dates

The Campus is closed and there will be no on-site classes at least till April 20, probably longer.

We will still meet at the time scheduled in LSF each week, Links to video conferencing will be posted in Moodle.

Lectures will be done as flipped classroom: You need to prepare the topic beforehand, and I will mostly answer questions during the lectures.

During distance learning, which may be for the whole term, I will make use of the lab time for individual sessions with the teams.

Note that there is required reading to read *before* class.

{% comment %}
We meet each week for 2 x 1,5hrs. Although the schedule is split up into lecture and lab (SU+Ü) we
will split up the time between lectures, assignments and practice and time for project work into your
team more dynamically within these 3 hours.

Your grade in WTAT1 will be a weighted mixture of the evaluated graded elements of the course.

s. Those are not graded, but you need to turn in viable reports for each topic approximately every two weeks.
* Quizzes: after the completion of each topic, there will be a brief Moodle quiz about the topic covered. If you choose to participate in those quizzes, they may count as 50% of your grade
* Exam: There will be a Moodle exam at the end of term. It either counts
    * 50% with the points from the quizzes as other 50%
    * 100% if you get a better grade this way either because you didn't participate in the quizzes or have achieved fewer points than in the exam (yay! automatically. You don't even have to choose.)
