Welcome! This class will give you an introduction on how Computer Networks, especially the Internet, work.

## Module and Context

B9 Netzwerke is a required class in the IMI-B Curriculum, scheduled for the 2nd
term. If you check the Studien- und Prüfungsordnung
([AMBl. 28/2012 on overview page here](https://imi-bachelor.htw-berlin.de/studium/ordnungen-module/#c4106),
[direct link here](https://imi-bachelor.htw-berlin.de/fileadmin/HTW/Zentral/Rechtsstelle/Amtliche_Mitteilungsblaetter/2012/28_12.pdf) )
you'll find that it consists of 2 SWS Lecture (SU) and 1 SWS Lab (Ü) each week,
but still 5 ECTS. Compared to Info2, this is half the time in class, with the
same weekly workload!

## Content and Textbook

The class will be based on the Textbook

Kurose, James F; Ross, Keith W.: Computer Networking. A Top-Down Approach, 8th ed., Pearson Global Editions, Harlow UK, 2021.
ISBN: 978-1-292-40546-9

We'll follow the books top-down approach - starting from applications like email and the web down to the physical network layer:

- Computer Networks and the Internet          
- Application Layer                     
- Transport Layer                                      
- The Network Layer: Data Plane                                   
- The Network Layer: Control Plane                                    
- The Link Layer and LANs    

The book will be available as ebook through the HTW Library.
There is also plenty of material online - [see the resources section](./resources).

## Class Structure and Meetings

For each chapter in the book, you will work on a lab assignment as a group and
prepare and hand in a written lab report. These lab reports are the main part
of your work, and you will have opportunity to work on them during the Lectures
as well as during the lab, but probably will need more time than that to complete it.

Lectures are organized as flipped-classroom: you need
to prepare for the class meetings by reading the according sections in the book and/or
watching the lecture videos.
Lectures start with a knowledge test covering the required reading.

See the [schedule](./schedule) and the [lab pages](./labs) for more details on that.

## Grading

There will be a Moodle exam at the end of term which will be offered
in PZ1 and PZ2.

Grades are determined like this:

- Moodle Exam 50%
- Lab Reports 40%
- Knowledge Checks 20%

The Moodle Exam constitutes the "Schriftliche Modulabschlussprüfung",
Lab Reports and Knowledge Checks are two "Modulbegleitend geprüfte Studienleistungen"
as described and regulated in §8 and §12 in the [Rahmenstudien- und -prüfungsordnung (RStPO – Ba/Ma)](https://www.htw-berlin.de/hochschule/dokumente/rahmenordnungen/#c6063).
