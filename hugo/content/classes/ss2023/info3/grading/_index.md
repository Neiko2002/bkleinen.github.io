### Labs
More Info about the parts that make up your lab grade can be found on the [Labs](labs) page.

The Labs grade is made up of three parts:

| Lab Part      |             | Points    |
|:--------------|:------------|:----------|
| Lab Hand ins: | (7 x 2P = ) | 14 Points |
| Oral Tests:   | (7 x 3P = ) | 21 Points |
| Peer Reviews: | (2 x 3P = ) | 6 Points  |
| Sum           |             | 41        |

## Exam

There will be a 2-hour online examination at the end of the semester.

## I have already taken Info3 last semester and passed the labs!

Congrats! Tell Prof. Kleinen and Prof. Weber-Wulff that you would like to keep your grade for the lab. It is recommended that you still do the labs of this semester for yourself (you can ask for help/ feedback of course) so you can learn about JavaScript (the topics of the lab can be in the exam).


## Grades

Your grade in Info3 will be a weighted mixture of the evaluated graded elements of the course and the exam. The partial grades will be assessed as follows and then graded according to the [Grading Scale]({{ site.BaseURL }}/studies/grading/grading-scale):

**Update Dec 3: Due to the ongoing COVID-19 situation, the Exam will be replaced
by an continuous assessment consisting of a couple of little project and report
assignments which can and need to be done individually at home** These take the
place of the exam, everything in the Lab and the complete grading scheme stays
the same:


Option 1: only Exam
* ~~Exam~~ [Continuous Assessment](./continuous_assessment) 100%
* all 7 lab reports need to be turned in before the exam

Option 2: Labs & Exam
* ~~Exam~~ [Continuous Assessment](./continuous_assessment) 50%
* Labs 50%
* all 7 lab reports need to be turned in before the exam

You don't have to decide which option you choose, the one that results in the better grade for you at the end of the
semester will automatically be picked.
